# Object-Counter-in-Images

First of all I tried this project just to revise about `opencv`.

In this project I wrote just few line of code in python and try to find the number of objects in the given images. I also upload those images on which I tried this code.

You can try this project on any image and see how this code is perform on that image.

Here I provide one output from those images :
